- to inherit the value of the $PATH from the shell into Emacs (or any application in
  Mac OS X), insert this into file /etc/profile (the first two lines are probably there
  already):

    if [ -x /usr/libexec/path_helper ]; then
        eval `/usr/libexec/path_helper -s`
        defaults write $HOME/.MacOSX/environment PATH "$PATH"
    fi

  You will need to restart the computer every time when the PATH variable is changed,
  for the changes to take effect.
