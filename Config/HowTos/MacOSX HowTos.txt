- to inherit the value of the $PATH from the shell into Emacs (or any application in
  Mac OS X), insert this into file /etc/profile (the first two lines are probably there
  already):

    if [ -x /usr/libexec/path_helper ]; then
        eval `/usr/libexec/path_helper -s`
        defaults write $HOME/.MacOSX/environment PATH "$PATH"
    fi

  You will need to restart the computer every time when the PATH variable is changed,
  for the changes to take effect.

- to change the PATH variable for Emacs etc. directly (in case the previous trick didn't
  work), go to file $HOME/.MacOSX/environment.plist, and modify the value of PATH,
  using the default editor (Property List Editor)

- how to enable native NTFS read/write support:
    - first, uninstall NTFS-3G:
        - run 'sudo port uninstall macfuse'
        - run script: ./Scripts/del-ntfs-3g (give it 'execute' permission, if necessary)
        - if the Windows disk is not mounted: 'diskutil mountDisk /dev/disk0'
    - In Terminal, type 'diskutil info /Volumes/volume_name', where 'volume_name' is the
      name of the NTFS volume. From the output, copy the 'Volume UUID' value to the
      clipboard.
    - Back up /etc/fstab if you have it; it shouldn't be there in a default install.
    - Type 'sudo emacs /etc/fstab'. (Use 'nano' if emacs is not available.)
    - In the editor, type 'UUID=', then paste the UUID number you copied from the
      clipboard. Type a Space, then type 'none ntfs rw'. The final line should look like
      this: 'UUID=123-456-789 none ntfs rw', where 123-456-789 is the UUID you copied in
      the first step.
    - Repeat the above steps for any other NTFS drives/partitions you have.
    - Save the file and quit emacs (or nano: Control-X, Y, Enter), then restart your
      system.

- how to capture a screen shot:
    - use Grab (bundled utility, located in the Applications > Utilities folder)
    - choose menu Capture > Window (or Cmd+Shift+W); the new screen shot image will open
      in a new window
    - save the image

- in Terminal, to have the Option key (on the keyboard) act as meta key (useful in Emacs):
    - in the terminal's main menu, go to Terminal -> Preferences -> Settings -> Keyboard
    - select the “Use option as meta key” checkbox

- to run Google Chrome in mode that allows accessing local files through Ajax calls,
  run in Terminal:

    sudo open -a '/Applications/Google Chrome.app' --args '--allow-file-access-from-files'
