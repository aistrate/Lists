- to avoid getting a "Contact not authorized or not found" error when running the client site from VS, do EITHER one of the following:
    1. Set your Start Page for the web application to a page that doesn't need a ContactId (e.g., Charts.aspx needs a non-zero ContactId if logged in as an Asset Manager employee, but will work with a missing/zero ContactId if logged in as a Customer). The safest bets are Default.aspx and Authenticate/Login.aspx, which work for any login type.
    2. In web.config, set <customErrors mode="On" ... />. The custom error page (AppErrors.aspx) will catch all unhandled ContactNotFoundException's and redirect the user to Default.aspx, which will redirect to a role-specific page (e.g., PortfolioPositions.aspx for Customers, ClientPortfolios.aspx for Remisier employees, etc.).
