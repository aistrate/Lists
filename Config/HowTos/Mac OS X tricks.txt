1. To make a symbolic (soft) link to a file having path name <file-path>:
        ln -s <file-path> <link-name>
   
   In the 'man ln' page, the old (existing) <file-path> is called source_file, and the newly created link, target_file.

2. To add a directory to the PATH environment variable, add this to file ~/.profile:
        export PATH=<path>:$PATH
   
   If the path is still not seen by Emacs, add this to file ~/.emacs:
       (setenv "PATH" (concat (getenv "PATH") ":<path>"))
       (setq exec-path (append exec-path '("<path>")))
