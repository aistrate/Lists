- to make a symbolic (soft) link to a file having path name <file-path>:

    ln -s <file-path> <link-name>
   
  [In the 'man ln' page, the old (existing) <file-path> is called source_file, and
   the newly created link, target_file (Mac OS X).]


- to add a directory to the PATH environment variable, add this to file ~/.profile:

    export PATH=<path>:$PATH
   
  If the path is still not seen by Emacs, add this to file ~/.emacs:

    (setenv "PATH" (concat (getenv "PATH") ":<path>"))
    (setq exec-path (append exec-path '("<path>")))


- to give a script 'execute' permission:

    $ chmod 755 my_script


- to make a file available for execution from any directory, put it in $HOME/bin.

  Check whether $HOME/bin is in $PATH. If not, add this to file .profile
  (or .bash_profile) in the $HOME directory:

    if [ -d "$HOME/bin" ] ; then
        PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"
    fi
