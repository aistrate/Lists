Things I want to program:

- a compiler (or more, one for each programming paradigm: C, C#, Forth, Prolog, Lisp/Scheme, Haskell, Smalltalk)

- a 3D graphics program (ray tracing, shading, anti-aliasing, animation, etc.)

- a strong solver for a board game (Reversi, chess, etc.)

- a web browser engine (layout engine/rendering engine) that supports HTML, CSS, JavaScript and DOM; the JavaScript interpreter could be a semi-independent project (test: render Amazon.com pages)

- LINQ to NHibernate

- a mini-operating system (in C)

- a text editor, with syntax-highlighting (in Haskell and/or C)

- a regular expression parser (as a C# library)

- an interpreter for a purely dynamic language (a scripting language such as Python or Ruby)

- a constraint progamming engine (as a C# library, called a 'constraint solving toolkit')

- a spreadsheet (Excel-like, with formulas etc.)



Less likely:

- a simple video game (with real-time 3D graphics)

- a robot or physical device (that does something useful)

- a 2D graphics editing program (like Photoshop or Gimp)

- a font renderer (vector fonts, Bezier curves etc.)

- a web server (test: host an ASP.NET website, such as the TG client site); it should support HTTPS

- a full network stack (HTTP, TCP/IP)

- a basic symbolic computation system (symbolic integration and differentiation etc.)



Actually useful (for myself):

* a simple program for touch-typing practice (like Mavis Beacon, but NOT needing a graphics card): echo the typed text under the original (or superimposed over it, in a different color), beep when mistyping, report statistics such as WPM and error percentage (and time elapsed), import from file, keep history (file names and statistics) in a text file
