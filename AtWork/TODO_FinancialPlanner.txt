Financial Planner:


Big:
- popup(s) with details: model composition (pie chart), numerical details (standard deviation etc.)

* Main curve [old Excel sheet]
* Chance of meeting target (traffic lights) [old Excel sheet]
* History (Total Portfolio Value)
* Target curve (red) [new Excel sheet]
* Extra periodical/initial [new Excel sheet]
* Market uncertainty (SplineRange) [old Excel sheet]
* store Target amount on the Account (as well as other details: current Yearly Deposit, Years Left, etc.)
* change field YearsLeft into TargetEndDate


Small:
-!! check that series "Volatility (2x)" produces correct values (especially the max side)

-!! add new field to table RemisierEmployees (and new CheckBox column on page 'Remisier Logins') - HasSignedConfidentialityAgreement - which authorizes access to page 'Monitor Portefeuille'; also hide link to 'Monitor Portefeuille' on page 'Client Portfolios', if the field value is 'false'

-! save the full url of the client website (e.g., "https://www.mijnpaerel.nl") somewhere in the database, so that links to the website within generated emails will work properly

- keep the current AccountId between contact-specific pages (PortfolioPositions / [Charts] / Notas / FinancialReports / FinancialPlanner)

- page Charts - remember the selected Tab (and restore it when returning from another page, e.g., PortfolioPositions or FinancialPlanner)

- improve performance of page Charts by enabling ViewState for Dundas Chart controls; charts should be re-DataBound only when something has changed (e.g., the selected account), not every time a Tab is selected.

- verify all the pages that use SessionState to communicate with each other (e.g., AccountId); make sure that a user can work with more than one contact/account at a time, in the same ASP.NET session, in different browser tabs/windows (Firefox only has one session; IE8 also, by default), without the "workflows" getting mixed up

- replace Month and Year drop-down-lists with ComboBox extender control from AjaxControlToolkit

- enclose panel FutureValue in an UpdatePanel (for better performance etc.)

- use the Tabs control for the Extras (with/without sliders)

- check/correct GoalSeek for 'Chance of meeting target' = 80%

* check if moving the sliders causes any trip to the database
* calculate Market Uncertainty with two times (2x) standard deviation (volatility) (request of Sandor and the brokers)
* on pressing "Calculate"/"Recalculate": FinancialDataView is saved in ViewState, and the database is NOT accessed anymore until the next time the button is pressed; specifically, there's no database access when changing the extra periodical/initial deposits
* make panel "Extras" the same height for both views (i.e., with/without sliders), so that the Chart doesn't move up and down when switching
* field Volatiliteit (StandardDeviation) (given data) - should always be visible (either Label or TextBox), just like Prognoserendement (InterestRatePerYear)
* recalculate as little as possible of the chart (let the rest come from ViewState of Dundas Chart control)
* have less "points" (gradations) on the sliders (or disable animation effect)

* improve query performance for page "Client Portfolios"
* add switch for page "Client Portfolios" - flags per Contact / per Account
* find better icons for the color flags (red/yellow/green); e.g., Mac OS X Aqua-style lights (close/minimize/maximize window)
* is there a deposit at the end of the last period? (maybe there should be a flag)
* round 'Chance of reaching target' to a whole number (no decimals); adjust the color flag accordingly (e.g., 49.7% should display as 50%, and show as yellow, not red); also change on page Client Portfolios
* translate: "Market uncertainty", "History", "Volatility" ("Volatiliteit"?), Calculate/Recalculate (button), "Update target" (+ "Save target" and "Cancel"), "Please fill/correct fields with *"


Small bugs:

- page PositionTxsCash.aspx generates an error ("Invalid column name 'IsSystem'.")

- TrafficLight image (and/or its border) don't look well when printed (margins are chopped off)

- layout "collapses" after pressing link "Cancel" (for target update) in IE7; moreover, "display: inline-table" does not seem to work with IE7 (there is no space at all between Save and Cancel)

* page 'Client Portfolios' crashes when an account doesn't have a model (e.g., account 'EGBH30030')
* page 'Client Portfolios': logging in as remisier employee 'M. Calame' of remisier 'Arthur en Arthur' causes exception 'Contact not authorized or not found' (because a specific client has only active accounts which are not "owned" by the current remisier, and the account that does belong to the current remisier is inactive, so method IsContactOwned returns 'false')
* clicking on a slider without moving it causes the chart to "dissapear"
* double-click on an AccountNumber (page Client Portfolios) selects "EGVL012738 [Sunny (80% or over)]", instead of just the number (when doing copy/paste)
* Safari does not print the euro sign (on paper/preview) (Windows only)
* pressing Tab while in TextBox "Doelvermogen" moves focus to Save/Cancel link buttons first, instead of TextBox underneath
