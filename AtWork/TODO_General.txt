Page Remisier Logins:

-! what role(s) should the new (remisier employee) logins belong to?

- eliminate class SecurityLayerAdapter (use SecurityFilter directly)

* move FullName from Contact to ContactFormatter (?); FullName should also be a property of LoginPerson
* change 'New login name' letter (report) and 'New password' email (two variants each: one for clients, and one for remisier employees)
* Remisier Logins page: filtering (security-filtering for everything)
