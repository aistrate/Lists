Financial Planner:


Big:
- popup(s) with details: model composition (pie chart), numerical details (standard deviation etc.)

* Main curve [old Excel sheet]
* Chance of meeting target (traffic lights) [old Excel sheet]
* History (Total Portfolio Value)
* Target curve (red) [new Excel sheet]
* Extra periodical/initial [new Excel sheet]
* Market uncertainty (SplineRange) [old Excel sheet]
* store Target amount on the Account (as well as other details: current Yearly Deposit, Years Left, etc.)
* change field YearsLeft into TargetEndDate


Small:
-!! calculate Market Uncertainty with two times (2x) standard deviation (volatility) (request of Sandor and the brokers)

-! on pressing "Calculate"/"Recalculate": FinancialDataView is saved in ViewState, and the database is NOT accessed anymore until the next time the button is pressed; specifically, there's no database access when changing the extra periodical/initial deposits

-! recalculate as little as possible of the chart (let the rest come from ViewState of Dundas Chart control)

- check/correct GoalSeek for 'Chance of meeting target' = 80%

- field Volatiliteit (StandardDeviation) (given data) - should always be visible (either Label or TextBox), just like Prognoserendement (InterestRatePerYear)

* improve query performance for page "Client Portfolios"
* add switch for page "Client Portfolios" - flags per Contact / per Account
* find better icons for the color flags (red/yellow/green); e.g., Mac OS X Aqua-style lights (close/minimize/maximize window)
* is there a deposit at the end of the last period? (maybe there should be a flag)
* round 'Chance of reaching target' to a whole number (no decimals); adjust the color flag accordingly (e.g., 49.7% should display as 50%, and show as yellow, not red); also change on page Client Portfolios
* translate: "Market uncertainty", "History", "Volatility" ("Volatiliteit"?), Calculate/Recalculate (button), "Update target" (+ "Save target" and "Cancel"), "Please fill/correct fields with *"


Small bugs:
* clicking on a slider without moving it causes the chart to "dissapear"

* double-click on an AccountNumber (page Client Portfolios) selects "EGVL012738 [Sunny (80% or over)]", instead of just the number (when doing copy/paste)

* Safari does not print the euro sign (on paper/preview) (Windows only)

* pressing Tab while in TextBox "Doelvermogen" moves focus to Save/Cancel link buttons first, instead of TextBox underneath

- TrafficLight image (and/or its border) don't look well when printed (margins are chopped off)

- layout "collapses" after pressing link "Cancel" (for target update) in IE7; moreover, "display: inline-table" does not seem to work with IE7 (there is no space at all between labels Save and Cancel)
