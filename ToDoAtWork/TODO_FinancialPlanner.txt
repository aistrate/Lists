Financial Planner:

* Main curve [old Excel sheet]
* Chance of meeting target (traffic lights) [old Excel sheet]
* History (Total Portfolio Value)

* Target curve (red) [new Excel sheet]
* Extra periodical/initial [new Excel sheet]
* Market uncertainty (SplineRange) [old Excel sheet]
* store Target amount on the Account (as well as other details: current Yearly Deposit, Years Left, etc.)
- change field YearsLeft into TargetEndDate
[
- popup(s) with details: model composition (pie chart), numerical details (standard deviation etc.)
]

* improve query performance for page "Client Portfolios"
* add switch for page "Client Portfolios" - flags per Contact / per Account
* find better icons for the color flags (red/yellow/green); e.g., Mac OS X Aqua-style lights (close/minimize/maximize window)
- is there a deposit at the end of the last period? (maybe there should be a flag)
- combining Extra periodical/initial - should allow amounts LARGER than either of the two
- field Volatiliteit (StandardDeviation) (given data) - should always be visible (either Label or TextBox), just like Prognoserendement (InterestRatePerYear)
- translate: "Market uncertainty", "History", "Volatility" ("Volatiliteit"?), Calculate/Recalculate (button), "Update account target", "Save", "Cancel"
- double-click on an AccountNumber (page Client Portfolios) selects "EGVL012738 [Sunny (80% or over)]", instead of just the number
